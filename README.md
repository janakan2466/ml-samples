# Intelligent Systems
A collection of tasks.

Machine learning and pattern classification are fundamental blocks in the design of an intelligent system. This repository will track the fundamentals of machine learning and pattern classification concepts, theories, and algorithms. Topics covered include: Bayesian decision theory, linear discriminant functions, multilayer neural networks, classifier evaluation, and an introduction to unsupervised clustering/grouping, and other state-of-the-art machine learning and AI algorithms.
